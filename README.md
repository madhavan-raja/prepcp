# Prep CP

My competitive programming setup. Make sure your have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed.

## Usage

Edit either `main.cpp` or `input.txt` and test the code:

```sh
just test
```

If you have [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) installed, you can also watch the directory for changes and test the code automatically.

```sh
just watch
```
